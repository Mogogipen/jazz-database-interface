## Getting Started

In our presentation, we mentioned having 3 'prototypes'. This version was started in a different repository and copied over.
When double checking files, it looks like the file "Taskfile.yml" didn't happily commit...

I also noticed that there are some issues with the delete button...

### Taskfile.yml

```
version: '2'

tasks:
  build:
    cmds:
      - sassc -M -t compressed public/css/bulma-0.8.0/bulma.sass > public/css/bulma.css
    
```
